## Instalation
Download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and of [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). Clone the repository and open a command prompt in this folder (open the folder in file explorer and type `cmd` in the address bar).

Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` followed by `python CandleHue.py`. You should get a prompt message that tells you the Link button on you Philips Bridge is not pressed, press this button and enter `python CandleHue.py` again. It should now ask for a coin you want to track, enter the market abreviation in capital letters (for example `BTC` or `ETH`) and this coin will be tracked. Now enjoy!

## That is it
I wish you many green lights.
